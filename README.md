# Numerical_Methods_With_Scilab
These are short codes about some numerical methods implemented in scilab.

Here you are supposed to find :

- Algebraic equations: Bisection, Secant, Newton, Newton-Raphson, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Richardson, LU decomposition, Cholesky
- Interpolation / extrapolation : Vandermonde, Lagrange, Newton, Richardson, Aitken
- Integration : Rectangle, Trapezis, Simpson, Pncelet, Newton-CÃ´tes, Romberg
- Differentiation and Differential equations: Euler, Runge-kutta, Taylor, middle point, theta-scheme, ADI
- Sensivity analysis using LHC-PRCC
